            <p>Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international
                criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Later on, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
                complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <p>Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, he consistently showed prowess well-beyond his years, effortlessly learning new jutsu from simple observation, and rising rapidly through the ninja ranks.
                His prowess rivalled Shisui Uchiha, who was well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time. He was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets and gained praise from allies and foes alike; Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly
                admitted Itachi was stronger than he was.[52] Obito revealed that despite being weakened from illness and Sasuke having absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their battle if he wanted to.[53] Even when restraining
                himself, a team of jōnin were still pushed to their limits against Itachi.</p>

                <p>Itachi could summon crows, which he would typically call forth in flocks to swarm opponents and distract them. He even integrated crows into clones of himself that would draw opponents' attacks. He was likewise able to create shadow clones
                    and from which could lure in opponents before exploding. Itachi was also well-versed in fūinjutsu, particularly those that would activate in the presence of a specific person's Sharingan.[59][60] From his time in Anbu, Itachi became
                    proficient in stealth, infiltration, and assassination.</p>

                <h1>Genjutsu</h1>
                <h3><span class="crimson-color">1992-Present | Master of Mangekyō Sharingan</span></h3>
                <p>Consistent with his pacifist nature, Itachi specialised in genjutsu, where the illusions would typically involve crows. Regarded as one of Konohagakure's best users, even without the aid of his Sharingan, his illusions have remarkable
                    potency, able to seamlessly affect his targets without them realising it, while on guard, and also perform them by merely pointing at his target. He is noted by Ao to have such high prowess that he could use genjutsu to control other
                    individuals outside the range of even the Sensor Division.[66] Itachi could also use genjutsu to share information or psychologically disable opponents, letting him end the fight instantly.</p>
